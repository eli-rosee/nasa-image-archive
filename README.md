# ðŸš€ NASA APOD Data Pipeline
A personal data collection and engineering project designed to scrape, store, and prepare NASAâ€™s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) metadata and images for analysis. Condensing the Universe down into a single database.

## ðŸ”§ How the Code Works

The NASA APOD Data Pipeline automates scraping and storing astronomy image data. Using Python with BeautifulSoup, it retrieves metadata (links, image URLs, titles, dates, authors, credits, and descriptions) from NASAâ€™s APOD website. The parsed information is then cleaned and stored in a SQLite database, providing a lightweight, portable way to query and manage the data. Supporting scripts and tools handle parsing, normalization, and organization of files within a structured project directory. Git is used to version-control the codebase and track development.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
### This project is designed to:
- Strengthen Python scripting, web scraping, and text parsing skills.
- Build practical experience in database design and normalization.
- Practice Git workflows for code management and documentation.
- Lay a foundation for data analysis and visualization, with planned use of Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to explore trends and patterns in the APOD dataset.
